R and bash scripts for relationship analysis between hydrological prognosis and canopy characteristics.

Existence of vegetation and its ability to store precipitation is an
important element in water relations in the catchment. The process of 
interception is crucial at the beginning of a rainfall event. The main 
objective of the study was to verify the hypothesis that water level 
predictions are controlled by vegetation dynamics in the contributing 
mountainous basins. Data used herein are predictions provided by stochastic 
models and the ensemble multi-model forecast derived from the real-time rapid 
forecasting system. The satellite-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) images from 
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were also utilized. 
Correlation analysis between the plant maximum water storage capacity and 
statistics of skills and errors of hydrological forecasts was conducted. 
To cope with small sample size, the bootstrap simulation was performed.
